Customer application

My first attempt with ASP.NET MVC 6 with Visual Studio 2015. The application is using the razor view engine and the Entity
Framework for data access.

The SQL Server LocalDB is used. To create the database from the Customer class, I used these dnx commands:

dnu restore
dnvm use 1.0.0-rc1-final -p
dnx ef migrations add Initial
dnx ef database update
